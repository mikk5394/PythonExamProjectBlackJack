# PythonExamProjectBlackjack

    Assignment:
    
    Create a console application of the card game Blackjack.
    
    The rules of the game can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack
        I never got to implement being able to split, but I was told that wasn't needed

    Further requirements
    The game should be terminal based (text based), so no gui should be implemented.
    The game should be a single player game. One player against the computer.
    The player should be able to choose if he or she wants to be a player or a dealer.
        Was told this wasn't exactly needed as the dealer doesn't do anything beside drawing
    A bet functionality should be implemented.
    
    
    General for all projects:
    
    The project should be finished, meaning: donÂ´t hand in and show up at the exam with something half done.
        The project is finished and all required functionality are in the program
    Your code will be evaluated in terms of readability
        I've tried the https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ style guide as well as I could
    The code should be documented and you should be able to explain why you documented your code in the way you did.
        All of the code is thoroughly commented
    The code should be tested and you should at the exam be abel to talk about your tests and demonstrate them.
        There's a module called tests.py (also uploaded) which contains 10 unit tests
