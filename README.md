# PythonExamProjectBlackjack

    Assignment:
    
    
    Create a console application of the card game Blackjack.
    
    The rules of the game can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack
        - I never got to implement being able to split, but I was told that wasn't needed


    Further requirements:
    
    The game should be terminal based (text based), so no gui should be implemented. 
    The game should be a single player game. One player against the computer.
    The player should be able to choose if he or she wants to be a player or a dealer.
        - Was told this wasn't exactly needed as the dealer doesn't do anything beside drawing cards      
    A bet functionality should be implemented.
    
    
    General for all projects:
    
    The project should be finished, meaning: donÂ´t hand in and show up at the exam with something half done.
        - The project is finished and all required functionality are in the program        
    Your code will be evaluated in terms of readability
        - I've tried following the https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ style guide as well as I could        
    The code should be documented and you should be able to explain why you documented your code in the way you did.
        - All of the code is thoroughly commented        
    The code should be tested and you should at the exam be abel to talk about your tests and demonstrate them.
        - There's a module called tests.py (also uploaded) which contains 10 unit tests
    
    
    How to run the program:
    
    Download the 2 .py files and run the script.py and the game will start. (The tests.py is not needed to run the game)
    At first the player will be asked how much he/she wish to buy in for. 
    Afterwards the player is prompted to place a bet and the first round begins.
    After each round the player is asked if he/she wants to play again. If not, press q enter and the game will stop.
    If the player hits 0 in balance, the player will be asked to buy in again.
